Any call to the object is guaranteed to succeed from the caller's\n *    perspective to the maximum extent that this can be ensured. However, all\n *    failures of the object are reported as fatal errors. For example, if local\n *    mute fails, then that is a privacy issue and we must tear down the\n *    connection and try starting over.\n *\n * 2. State is owned by the object and is considered authoritative at all times.\n *    For example, if [[realtimeIsLocalAudioMuted]] is true then the user *is*\n *    muted.\n *\n * 3. Callbacks are fired synchronously and do their work synchronously. Any\n *    unnecessary asynchronous implementation only invites latency and\n *    increases the surface error for potential errors.\n *\n * 4. Mutation only occurs when state changes. All state-changing functions are\n *    idempotent.\n *\n * 5. Every conditional branch gets its own if statement and test coverage is\n *    100% for this object.\n *\n * 6. Function parameters and returns use primitives only (no classes or enums).\n *    This minimizes the number of dependencies that consumers have to take on\n *    and allows the object to be more easily wrapped. Values are normalized\n *    where possible.\n *\n * 7. The object takes no other non-realtime dependencies.\n *\n * 8. Interface functions begin with `realtime` to make boundaries between the\n *    RealtimeController interface and the UI or business logic explicit and\n *    auditable.\n *\n * 9. Local state overrides remote state but not vice-versa. For example, if\n *    locally muted with an active audio input and a remote state indicates the\n *    same user is unmuted because the muted state has not yet propagated, then\n *    the volume indicator update for the user would show the remote mute state\n *    as muted. However, if locally muted without an active audio input and a\n *    remote state indicates the user is unmuted (since they are dialed in), the\n *    remote state persists but does not override the local state so\n *    [[realtimeIsLocalAudioMuted]] still returns true.\n */\nclass DefaultRealtimeController {\n    constructor() {\n        this.state = new RealtimeState_1.default();\n    }\n
